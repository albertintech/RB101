# Given the following data structure, return a new array containing the same sub-arrays as the original but ordered logically by only taking into consideration the odd numbers they contain.

arr = [[1, 6, 7], [1, 4, 9], [1, 8, 3]]

# The sorted array should look like this:

[[1, 8, 3], [1, 6, 7], [1, 4, 9]]
