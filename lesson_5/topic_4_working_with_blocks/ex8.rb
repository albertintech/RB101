# It can be tricky to work with different objects in a nested array if you want to only select nested elements based on certain criteria. For example, take the 2-element array below, where we only want to select integers greater than 13 but strings less than 6 characters. The trick here is that the elements are in a two layer nested array data structure.

[[8, 13, 27], ['apple', 'banana', 'cantaloupe']].map do |arr|
  arr.select do |item|
    if item.to_s.to_i == item    # if it's an integer
      item > 13
    else
      item.size < 6
    end
  end
end
# => [[27], ["apple"]]

#At first you might think to reach for the select method to perform selection, but since we're working with a nested array, that won't work. We first need to access the nested arrays before we can select the value we want. In order to select the specified values in the requirement, we need to first determine if an element is an integer; there are lots of ways to do this, we just went with the imperfect item.to_s.to_i == item test.

# One of the main reasons map is used in this example is not only to iterate over the array and access the nested arrays, but to return a new array containing the selected values. If we used each instead we wouldn't have the desired return value, and would need an extra variable to collect the desired results.
