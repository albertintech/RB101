# Given the munsters hash below

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

# Modify the hash such that each member of the Munster family has an additional "age_group" key that has one of three values describing the age group the family member is in (kid, adult, or senior). Your solution should produce the hash below

{ "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male", "age_group" => "adult" },
  "Lily" => {"age" => 30, "gender" => "female", "age_group" => "adult" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male", "age_group" => "senior" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male", "age_group" => "kid" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female", "age_group" => "adult" } }

# Note: a kid is in the age range 0 - 17, an adult is in the range 18 - 64 and a senior is aged 65+.

# Hint:
# Try using a case statement along with Ruby Range objects in your solution
