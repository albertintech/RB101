# Your friends just showed up! Given the following array of names, use a for loop to greet each friend individually.

friends = ['Sarah', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Dave']

# for i in friends do
#   puts i
# end

# Read: for every 'i' element in 'x collection' do this for every i

# The concise version:

friends.each { |i| puts i}
