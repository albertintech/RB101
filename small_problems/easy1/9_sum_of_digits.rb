# Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of its digits.

# Examples

puts sum(23) == 5
puts sum(496) == 19
puts sum(123_456_789) == 45

# The tests above should print true.
#
# For a challenge, try writing this without any basic looping constructs (while, until, loop, and each).
