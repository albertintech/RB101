# Write a method that takes one argument, a string, and returns a new string with the words in reverse order.
#
# Examples:

puts reverse_sentence('Hello World') == 'World Hello'
puts reverse_sentence('Reverse these words') == 'words these Reverse'
puts reverse_sentence('') == ''
puts reverse_sentence('    ') == '' # Any number of spaces results in ''

# The tests above should print true.
